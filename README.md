This is my first program in many years. I have a large personal library that I
wished to catalog to keep a record of all my books.

Planned Features:

1. Get book information from the web and store it in a local database, probably SQL
 * OpenLibrary (API calls and processing appear functional)
 * GoodReads (Future)
 * Google Books (Work in progress)
 * Library of Congress (Most comprehensive source for LCCNs) (Future)
2. Book records features
 * Title
 * Author
 * Genre
 * Publisher
 * Year of publication
 * ISBN-13, ISBN-10, LCCN (whichever are available)
 * Book condition
 * Lending status
3. Library features
 * Add books
 * Remove books
 * Update book condition (future)
 * Destroyed/damaged beyond useability books (future)

Pipe dreams:

1. GUI
2. Android app to check your local database for books you already own
3. Barcode scanning
