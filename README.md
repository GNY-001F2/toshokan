This is my first program in many years. I have a large personal library that I
wished to catalog to keep a record of all my books.

Planned Features (Future indicates features that won't be worked on until the
program is already functional):

1. Get book information from the web and store it in a local database, probably SQL
 * Access OpenLibrary's API
 * Access GoodReads's API (Future)
 * Access Google Books' API (Future)
 * Only store information available with publisher
2. Book records features
 * Title
 * Author
 * Genre
 * Publisher
 * Year of publication
 * ISBN-13, ISBN-10, LCCN (whichever are available)
 * Book condition
 * Lending status
3. Library features
 * Add books
 * Remove books
 * Update book condition (future)
 * Destroyed/damaged beyond useability books (future)

Possible pipe dreams:

1. GUI
2. Android app to check your local database for books you already own
